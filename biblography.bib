abstract = {Hyperspectral systems have improved significantly through recent advancements in sensor technology, which have made possible to acquire data with several hundred channels. These advances provide the possible benefit of not only collecting more detailed information than previously possible, but also of producing more accurate data. Some of the major challenges in handling such large data sets are removing redundant information and assuring the continued relevance of vital information to the application at hand. For example, conventional methods for land use and land cover classifications may not be applicable, due to the large data volumes used to characterize hyperspectral cubes. Therefore, these conventional methods may require a preprocessing step, namely dimension reduction. Dimension reduction can be seen as a transformation from a high order dimension to a low order dimension in order to conquer the so- called "curse of the dimensionality," which eliminates data redundancy. Principal Component Analysis ({\{}PCA){\}} is one such data reduction technique, which is often used when analyzing remotely sensed data. In computing the principal components, the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the 3-D image must be computed. Since this is a global operation it requires high computational resources and requires whole image to be stored which increases memory requirements. This paper reports an hierarchical algorithm, which can effectively reduce the hyperspectral data to intrinsic dimensionality. In the hierarchical {\{}PCA{\}}, we break the image into various parts and then perform {\{}PCA{\}} on each part separately and then combine the results. The classification results over the original and the resulting reduced data have been compared. The results show that reduced data obtained by hierarchical {\{}PCA{\}} can compare favorably to the results obtained from original data.},

abstract = {Displaying the abundant information contained in a hyperspectral image is a challenging problem. Almost any visualization approach reduces the information content. However, we want to maximize the amount of object or material information presented. A visualization approach that uses classification as an intermediate step may maximize the information transfer. In our research, we are particularly interested in the display of mixed-pixel classification results, since most pixels in a remotely sensed hyperspectral image are mixed pixels. In this paper, we propose a visualization technique that employs two layers to integrate the mixture information (i.e., endmembers and their abundances) in each pixel. Images can be displayed with any desired level of details.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new framework to visualize hyperspectral images. We present three goals for such a visualization: 1) preservation of spectral distances; 2) discriminability of pixels with different spectral signatures; 3) and interactive visualization for analysis. The introduced method considers all three goals at the same time and produces higher quality output than existing methods. The technical contribution of our mapping is to derive a simplified convex optimization from a complex nonlinear optimization problem. During interactive visualization, we can map the spectral signature of pixels to red, green, and blue colors using a combination of principal component analysis and linear programming. In the results, we present a quantitative analysis to demonstrate the favorable attributes of our algorithm.},

@article{Czarnecki2015,
abstract = {Representation learning is currently a very hot topic in modern machine learning, mostly due to the great success of the deep learning methods. In particular low-dimensional representation which discriminates classes can not only enhance the classification procedure, but also make it faster, while contrary to the high-dimensional embeddings can be efficiently used for visual based exploratory data analysis. In this paper we propose Maximum Entropy Linear Manifold (MELM), a multidimensional generalization of Multithreshold Entropy Linear Classifier model which is able to find a low-dimensional linear data projection maximizing discriminativeness of projected classes. As a result we obtain a linear embedding which can be used for classification, class aware dimensionality reduction and data visualization. MELM provides highly discriminative 2D projections of the data which can be used as a method for constructing robust classifiers. We provide both empirical evaluation as well as some interesting theoretical properties of our objective function such us scale and affine transformation invariance, connections with PCA and bounding of the expected balanced accuracy error.},

abstract = {We propose a specific content-based image retrieval (CBIR) system for hyperspectral images exploiting its rich spectral information. The CBIR image features are the endmember signatures obtained from the image data by endmember induction algorithms (EIAs). Endmembers correspond to the elementary materials in the scene, so that the pixel spectra can be decomposed into a linear combination of endmember signatures. EIA search for points in the high dimensional space of pixel spectra defining a convex polytope, often a simplex, covering the image data. This paper introduces a dissimilarity measure between hyperspectral images computed over the image induced endmembers, proving that it complies with the axioms of a distance. We provide a comparative discussion of dissimilarity functions, and quantitative evaluation of their relative performances on a large collection of synthetic hyperspectral images, and on a dataset extracted from a real hyperspectral image. Alternative dissimilarity functions considered are the Hausdorff distance and robust variations of it. We assess the CBIR performance sensitivity to changes in the distance between endmembers, the EIA employed, and some other conditions. The proposed hyperspectral image distance improves over the alternative dissimilarities in all quantitative performance measures. The visual results of the CBIR on the real image data demonstrate its usefulness for practical applications.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014. Hyperspectral image analysis is among one of the current trends in computer vision and machine learning. Due to the high dimensionality, large number of classes, presence of noise and complex structure, this is not a trivial task. There exists a need for more precise and computationally efficient algorithms for hyperspectral image segmentation and classification. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm for segmentation of hyperspectral images and selecting valuable pixels for classifier training procedure. Our approach is based on Quad Tree Decomposition method, which detects homogeneous region in the input image. This allows to precisely detect groups with similar structure and recognize different possible classes on the image. We discuss the computational complexity of our algorithm and show that it can be easily used in real-life applications. Further, this algorithm is extended by active learning approach, which allows to select a single representative pixel for each detected homogeneous region. With this, the classifier is trained on a significantly reduced dataset without sacrificing its quality.We examine the correlation between the number of folds taken by our segmentation algorithm and used classifiers. We show, that the segmentation procedure can be stopped earlier without drop of the accuracy.},

There exist a need for introducing novel machine learning methods, that can tackle high dimensionality and large number of classes in these images. In this paper, we introduce a novel ensemble method for classification of hyperspectral data. The pool of classifiers is built on the basis of color decomposition of the given image. Each base classifier corresponds to a single color channel that is extracted. We propose a new method for decomposing hyperspectral image into 11 different color channels. As not all of the channels may bear as useful information as other, we need to promote the most relevant ones. For this, our ensemble uses a weighted trained fuser, which uses a neural methods for establishing weights. We show, that the proposed ensemble can outperform other state-of-the-art classifiers in the given task. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer International Publishing.},

abstract = {Nowadays, the hyperspectral imaging is the focus of intense research, because its applications can be very useful in the natural disaster monitoring and agricultural monitoring to enumerate only a few. The main problem of systems using hyperspectral imaging is the cost of labelling, because it requires the domain experts, who label the region or prepare the labelled learning set for machine learning methods. The article presents a novel Hyperspectral Segmentation Algorithm which is a part of a general framework used for image classification. The algorithm is based on an image decomposition into homogeneous regions using a novel similarity measure. Three different region representations are proposed using the matrix notation. An additional procedure merges similar regions into larger ones to reduce human expert engagement in region labelling. The algorithm has been evaluated on the number of benchmark datasets to investigate the influence of algorithm parameters on the final performance. Comparison with competing methods proved that the considered algorithm is an interesting proposition in hyperspectral image analysis tasks.},

abstract = {This paper presents a Tibetan component representation learning method for component-based online handwritten Tibetan character recognition. In conventional methods, we designed features manually for Tibetan components. The hand-crafted features are often incomplete and decrease the component recognition accuracy, which influences component-based character recognition performance. To overcome the deficiency, we use three layer deep belief networks to learn automatically representation features for components. Restricted Boltzmann machine is used to construct each hidden layer. The weight parameters of the networks are optimized by greedy layer-wise learning algorithm. Then we combine representation learning based component classifier into our previous integrated segmentation and recognition framework. Finally we add syllable association module to improve the handwriting input speed. Experimental results on MRG-OHTC database show that the component representation learning method gives the promising performance. The proposed method achieves the component-level and character-level recognition rates of 94.78{\%} and 94.09{\%}.},

@patent{tamai_image_1999,
abstract = {An image processing apparatus converts color image data into hue, saturation and luminosity data. When a specific color portion and a range are designated in the hue data, processing for reducing tones is executed based on the designated data. Thereafter, a reverse-conversion into color image data is performed, thereby making it possible to output a high-quality image of an illustration. Further, a histogram of designated hue data is generated, processing for reducing tones is executed based on the histogram, and the data is subsequently reverse-converted into color image data. This makes it possible to output a higher quality image of an illustration.},

@article{tyo_principal-components-based_2003,
abstract = {A new pseudocolor mapping strategy for use with spectral imagery is presented. This strategy is based on a principal components analysis of spectral data, and it capitalizes on the similarities between three-color human vision and high-dimensional hyperspectral datasets. The mapping is closely related to three-dimensional versions of scatter plots that are commonly used in remote sensing to visualize the data cloud. The transformation results in final images where the color assigned to each pixel is solely determined by the position within the data cloud. Materials with similar spectral characteristics are presented in similar hues, and basic classification and clustering decisions can be made by the observer. Final images tend to have large regions of desaturated pixels that make the image more readily interpretable. The data cloud is shown to be conical in nature, and materials with common spectral signatures radiate from the origin of the cone, which is not (in general) at the origin of the spectral data. A supervised method for locating the origin of the cone based on identification of clusters in the data is presented, and the effects of proper origin orientation are illustrated.},

@article{yang2015,
abstract = {The extreme learning machine (ELM), which was originally proposed for ''generalized'' single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks, provides efficient unified learning solutions for the applications of clustering, regression, and classification. It presents competitive accuracy with superb efficiency in many applications. However, ELM with subnetwork nodes architecture has not attracted much research attentions. Recently, many methods have been proposed for supervised/unsupervised dimension reduction or representation learning, but these methods normally only work for one type of problem. This paper studies the general architecture of multilayer ELM (ML-ELM) with subnetwork nodes, showing that: 1) the proposed method provides a representation learning platform with unsupervised/supervised and compressed/sparse representation learning and 2) experimental results on ten image datasets and 16 classification datasets show that, compared to other conventional feature learning methods, the proposed ML-ELM with subnetwork nodes performs competitively or much better than other feature learning methods.},
